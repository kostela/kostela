## Hi, I'm Konstantin
   Senior Layout Engineer with more than 5 years of experience and good knowledge in layout design of CMOS analog integrated circuits. In general worked with gate arrays and IP blocks. Also I performed verification of layout adherence to design rules (DRC) and Layout-vs-Schematic checks using Cadence tools.
